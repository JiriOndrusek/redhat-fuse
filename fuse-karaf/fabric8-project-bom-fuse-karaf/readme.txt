This BOM is based on io.fabric8:fabric8-project-bom-fuse-karaf which was originally generated
in jboss-fuse/fabric8 project using sundr-maven-plugin.

Group ID is changed from io.fabric8 to org.jboss.redhat-fuse.

And it turns out that the only required dependencies in this bom are Netty dependencies (more managed
dependencies can be added here if needed).
